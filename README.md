In present days the environmental problem is one of the most serious problems. Energy consumption by industries and buildings are responsible for this problem. About 72% of world energy is consumed by infrastructure, industry, commercial buildings, residential houses, and markets. In a large building or complex, which is air‐conditioned, about 60% of the total energy requirement in the building is allocated for the air‐conditioning plant installed to use the cooling purpose.
