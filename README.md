## Cooling Load Estimation of SCE, Saharsa for Library and Computer Lab
In present days the environmental problem is one of the most serious problems. Energy
consumption by industries and buildings are responsible for this problem. About 72% of world
energy is consumed by infrastructure, industry, commercial buildings, residential houses, and
markets. In a large building or complex, which is air‐conditioned, about 60% of the total energy
requirement in the building is allocated for the air‐conditioning plant installed to use the cooling
purpose.
Exact prediction of the cooling and heating load, proper sizing of the heat ventilation airconditioning
(HVAC) system and optimal control of the HVAC systems are important to
minimize energy consumption. Root factors that affect cooling loads are the external climates
such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation and humidity. Local climatic conditions are
important parameters for the energy efficiency of buildings. Because the energy consumption in
buildings depends on the climatic conditions and the performance of heating ventilating and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems changes with them as well, better design in building HVAC
applications that take account of the right climatic conditions will result in better comfort and
more energy efficient buildings.
Calculation of thermal load of building is very essential to find exact air-conditioning equipment
and air handling unit, to achieve comfort operation and good air distribution in the airconditioned
zone.
